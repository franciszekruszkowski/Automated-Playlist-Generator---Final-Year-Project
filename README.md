# Automated-Playlist-Generator-Final-Year-Project
Data Science and Analytics BSc Dissertation

The Automated Playlist Generator is a tool for not only professional musicians, but also for music enthusiasts. This prototype is meant to perform unsupervised clustering of music into playlists, given specific similarity  features : General, Bassline, Harmonics, Percussions. Especially for electronic music, sorting our similar sounding tracks into appropriate playlists helps to find the right song in the right moment to fit in the current mood. For live performers like DJâ€™s, organising the music collection consisting of hundreds of tracks can be a significant improvement to the overall quality of their performance. The process of clustering into playlists is unsupervised by using the predicted values of the encoder layer from the Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder. Since all of the songs are grouped together according to specific extracted musical features, with no pre-assigned genre/sub-genre labels, there is no room for subjectivity. This tool can also be implemented in song recommendation systems, giving the user more freedom by allowing them to add specific filters when looking for new tracks.
